        I’m currently in college studying software development. It is my first year   and I must say I really like it. I got here because I needed a further education. I searched on the internet for studies with computers (because I like computers).
The first school that came across was Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam because they had a software development study, but Rotterdam was too far for me. So, I searched further on the internet and came across ROC Mondriaan, I was interested in IT System and Devices but when I scrolled further down on the page I saw Software Developer, I immediately signed up. Eventually I had my interview they saw potential in me, so they accepted me immediately. That’s how I got here.
I’m passionate about coding and all the things around coding. Because you have the freedom to make anything you want, and you can control everything about it. When I started coding, I saw a lot of potential for all the things I’m able to create. 
One of my professional accomplishments is that I learned the code HTML. I think that it is a big accomplishment because it is the base of coding.
Right now, I’m not looking for a job or anything I’m just focusing on my study. But I am interested in al kind of jobs such as cybercrimes, app development and creating software. Right now I would mostly want to have a job with cybercrime because I like things that have to do with crime/police.
